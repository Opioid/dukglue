Dukglue - no RTTI
=======

I wanted to try [dukglue](https://github.com/Aloshi/dukglue), but I did not want to enable RTTI for my [project](https://github.com/Opioid/sprout).
This is the sloppy result. I only made some ad-hoc changes as they became necessary for my integration and have not bothered to update the tests.

Not sure how I move forward with this.
